                        <p>
                        Meet the world's most important coffee disease that you've never heard of - rust fungus, a.k.a. "la roya."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Its spores, which can devastate entire coffee farms, forced Sri Lanka to uproot all its coffee trees in the 1860s and start growing tea. Today, climate conditions have accelerated the fungus' growth in Central America, uprooting farmers and fueling a wave of immigration to the U.S. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The current crisis started brewing in Guatemalan farms in 2010. Since then, it has affected 11 countries from Mexico to Peru, becoming the worst episode of coffee rust since the disease first appeared in our hemisphere in 1976. Central American countries, however, have been the hardest hit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The disease shows up as yellow spots on the leaves of a coffee tree, but by then it's too late: photosynthesis stops, leaves drop, and coffee cherries stop growing. To wipe la roya out, farmers have to stump all trees and wait out the loss for two to three years – a hit many farmers can't absorb.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Coffee rust fungus lives in a Goldilocks-like climate range: not too hot, not too cold, and a little bit wet. It can't survive below 50 degrees, so it's usually restricted to elevations below 5,250 feet. Farmers were unprepared when the fungus started showing up on farms at altitudes reaching 6,550 feet.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6 text-xs-left">
                        
                        <p>
                        Minimum temperatures at night have been rising in coffee-producing regions of Central America, even as maximum temperatures stay stable, said Peter Baker, a senior scientist for commodities and climate that advises the Central American coffee association PROMECAFE. Add that nighttime warmth to rainy conditions, and suddenly coffee rust is reaching higher altitudes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        "That is the alarm signal that climate has something to do with this," Baker said.He says they've also seen increases in other pests with strange names – red spider mites, coffee bera bera, ojo de gallo that may also be caused by changes in climate. "Pests and diseases, that's what we expect with weird weather."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Some farmers have also pointed to what they say is a more fungicide-resistant strain of coffee fungus. But experts say in those cases it is likely that farmers simply applied the pesticides too late. The Colombian coffee industry, which has kept meticulous samples and genetic records, has said there's no evidence that this fungus is different from past outbreaks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Coffee behemoths, like Colombia, can weather such a plague. Coffee rust wiped out 40 percent of Colombia's crop in 2008, during a particularly rainy La Nina. The Colombian Coffee Growers Federation spent more than $1 billion replanting la roya resistant coffee varieties. The "100% Colombian coffee" label quietly disappeared from U.S. grocery stores for a few years, but the Colombian coffee industry survived.

                        Specializing in Arabica beans, these high-end specialty coffees don't have deep pockets, experts said. They have even less resources to invest after the price of coffee plummeted in 2012, owing somewhat to Colombia's recovery.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                        Coffee production is at stake in Central America," said coffee trader David Piza, who has been working with small producers to find solutions. He said the decline in production is also hurting U.S. companies that depend on coffee beans from that part of the world.

                        His concern is shared by the U.S. government. Last year, USAID announced a $5 million effort with Texas A&M to seek solutions, including cross breeding coffee to find more disease resistant varieties. In announcing the initiative, USAID's Associate Administrator Mark Feierstein made it clear that it was more than just about economics.
                        </p>  
                        <p>
                        We must tackle this outbreak to ensure farmers and laborers have stable incomes, don't start growing illicit crops, or be forced to migrate because they can no longer support their families," Feierstein said.
